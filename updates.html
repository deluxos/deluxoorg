          <p>Compromised deployer address and revised distribution plans.</p>
          <p>Long time no see. A lot has happened over the past year, with the biggest development being that the deployer address for Deluxo was compromised. All remaining DLUX in the deployer address have been moved to 0x966a4a910b7de4105b4c691cd00de3bc94aff94e so that it can be safely distributed in the future.</p>
          <p>Also, the distribution plans have changed. My understanding of Ethereum 2.0 was flawed, and it is still not possible to mass distribute ERC-20 tokens without facing ridiculous gas fees. I will continue to search for a logical solution for the mass distribution of DLUX. In the meantime, I will still be collecting Ethereum addresses on the home page for when distribution is possible.</p>

          <p>Send me your Ethereum addresses!</p>
          <p>You may have noticed a new entry box on the home page of the website... that's because it is COLLECTION TIME! I have found a service that will be able to help me distribute the Deluxo to a mass amount of addresses without having to spend individual transaction fees. So now, I am ready to start collecting the Ethereum addresses of people who would like to receive some Deluxo. Please go to the <a href="index.php">home page</a>, type in your Ethereum address, and follow me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/deluxo">Twitter</a> to know when the Deluxo will be distributed. The whitepaper has also been updated accordingly.</p>

          <p>Changes to the whitepaper.</p>
          <p>After reviewing the whitepaper, I felt that the distribution plans needed some adjustments. The old ones were outdated and practically made no sense. Thus, the new Plan A and B were born. There are now plans for current Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0. Also, some slight adjustments to the website header were made.</p>

          <p>Complete website redesign and whitepaper!</p>
          <p>The whole website received a much needed makeover (inside and out), and is now uitlizing Bootstrap's toolkit. No more static webpages, hello responsive, mobile-supported glory. The website now has a beautiful, default dark theme (bye-bye blinding white background) and a navigation bar up-top. Also, homepage information has been updated to better explain Deluxo's purpose. With the edition of the website redesign, I have finally made a whitepaper for Deluxo.</p>
          <p>You can view the whitepaper by clicking the link at the top of the page. Heads up, expect painful honesty when reading it. An abridged version of the whitepaper: Deluxo is a non-unique crypto-collectible. The goal is to reach as many wallets as possible, and have some sort of monetary value. </p>
